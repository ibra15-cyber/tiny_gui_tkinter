# tiny_gui_tkinter

first tkinter app

first we import thinker

we create an object and save with a variable

we create a button it takes tkinter obj argument a displayed text and command 
which is our fn

we create an entry 
takes our tk obj an entry tha twill will be text
we declare a variable or propert of the field as StringVar

we create a text string 

we created a fn to convert from km to miles

in both cases we used the grip(row, col) to state where it shd appear on the window

how it works 
so our entry takes a value that value is used by our fn to do the math
by adding the get() to get the value
the outcome of the math is inserted in our text field
